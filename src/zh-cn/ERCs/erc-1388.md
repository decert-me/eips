### 介绍

在智能合约中，我们需要处理与用户标识符或能力相关的加密证明的方法。假设我们有一家房地产中介 KiwiRealtors，通过智能合约提供“表达兴趣”功能，并要求用户提供他们是新西兰或澳大利亚居民的证明，作为法律要求。这在新西兰房地产市场中确实发生过，是处理此类证明需求的完美例子。

然而，智能合约显式信任证明发行者并不实际。可以提供个人居住证明的发行者有很多——地方治安法官、土地登记处、当地警察、护照管理局等。我们设想一种模型，将管理合格发行者列表的工作实际外包给一个列表。

任何人都可以发布发行者列表。只有最受信任和精心维护的列表才能广泛使用。

### 目的
此 ERC 提供了一个智能合约接口，供任何人管理证明发行者的列表。智能合约将显式信任该列表，因此也信任列表上发行者发出的所有证明。

### 草案实现
```solidity
    /* The purpose of this contract is to manage the list of attestation
     * issuer contracts and their capacity to fulfill requirements
     */
 contract ManagedListERC
    {
      /* a manager is the steward of a list. Only he/she/it can change the
       * list by removing/adding attestation issuers to the list.

       * An issuer in the list is represented by their contract
       * addresses, not by the attestation signing keys managed by such a
       * contract.
       */
      struct List
      {
	      string name;
	      string description; // short description of what the list entails
	      string capacity; // serves as a filter for the attestation signing keys
	  /* if a smart contract specifies a list, only attestation issued
	   * by issuers on that list is accepted. Furthermore, if that
	   * list has a non-empty capacity, only attestations signed by a
	   * signing key with that capacity is accepted. */

	    address[] issuerContracts; // all these addresses are contracts, no signing capacity
	    uint expiry;
      }

      // find which list the sender is managing, then add an issuer to it
      function addIssuer(address issuerContractAddress) public;

      //return false if the list identified by the sender doesn't have this issuer in the list
      function removeIssuer(address issuerContractAddress, List listToRemoveIssuerFrom) public returns(bool);

      /* called by services, e.g. Kiwi Properties or James Squire */
      /* loop through all issuer's contract and execute validateKey() on
       * every one of them in the hope of getting a hit, return the
       * contract address of the first hit. Note that there is an attack
       * method for one issuer to claim to own the key of another which
       * is mitigated by later design. */
       //loop through the issuers array, calling validate on the signingKeyOfAttestation
      function getIssuerCorrespondingToAttestationKey(bytes32 list_id, address signingKeyOfAttestation) public returns (address);

       /* for simplicity we use sender's address as the list ID,
	 * accepting these consequences: a) if one user wish to maintain
	 * several lists with different capacity, he or she must use a
	 * different sender address for each. b) if the user replaced the
	 * sender's key, either because he or she suspects the key is
	 * compromised or that it is lost and reset through special means,
	 * then the list is still identified by the first sender's
	 * address.
      */

      function createList(List list) public;

      /* replace list manager's key with the new key */
      function replaceListIndex(List list, address manager) public returns(bool);

    }
```
